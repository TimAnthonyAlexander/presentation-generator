OpenAI API Key Configuration

To use this presentation generator, you need to place your OpenAI API key in this directory.

1. Create a file named "openai.txt" in this directory
2. Copy your OpenAI API key into this file as plain text with no other content
3. Save the file

Example:
If your API key is "sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12345", the content of the openai.txt file should be exactly:

sk-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz12345

Note: Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control.
